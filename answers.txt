Q: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A: A merge allows you:
	- Merge different branches
	- Show you the complete history of commit merging
	- All the commits on a feature branch are combined into a single commit on the master branch
	- Merge is best used when the target branch is supposed to be shared
	- Preserves history
   A Rebase allows you:
	- Integrate changes from one branch into another
	- As commits are rebased, history is altered to reflect this
	- All commits are rebased, and the same number of commits are added to the master branch
	- Rebase is best used when the target branch is private
	- Rewrites history
